              <h4 id="about-title">Who Are We?</h4>
                <p>As a team of students who have experienced first-hand frustration of downloading multiple apps to pay for parking, we wanted to make an app that makes this easier for people.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                After meeting our team for the first time and being unable to come up with any ideas for some time, we decided to call it a day and talk about it some more tomorrow. Most of us lived quite a distance from campus and had parked our cars in the parking lot. 
                <br>
                <br>
                “Hey, why don’t we go for food somewhere close by or something?” John and Khushbeen suggested.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Let me check how much time I had left on my parking,” Estevan said as he took out his phone.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Oh, wow, are those all parking apps? You have a whole folder of them!” Sherry said.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Yeah, I know, I don’t even use all of them that often, but I have to keep them just in case I don’t have WIFI to download a new app. And plus, that would waste a lot of time if I were in a hurry.”
                <br>
                <br>
                “Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just use one app and pay for parking throughout Vancouver, no matter the location or company?” said Steven.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Yeah, that would be pretty convenient.” We all nodded in unison.
